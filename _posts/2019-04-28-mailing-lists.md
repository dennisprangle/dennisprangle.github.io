I've been meaning to resurrect my blog to write a few posts on background information for graduate students.
These are things I wished I knew when I was doing my PhD 10 years ago, and will be most relevant for people working the same field of computational statistics as me.
Hopefully this will at least be useful to the students I'm advising if no-one else!
These posts are unlikely to be exhaustive, so please let me know about anything I've missed in the comments or on twitter.

This post is a short one on the topic of **mailing lists**.
Although a slightly old fashioned technology now, I find mailing lists are still the best place to read about announcements of conferences, workshops, jobs, interships etc.

The main mailing list for UK statistics announcements is [allstat](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=ALLSTAT).
There's also a nice [@allstat_mail](https://twitter.com/allstat_mail) feed of posts to the list.

The [ML-news](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ML-news) google group is good for international announcements on machine learning.

These two mailing lists have a huge number of posts.
The others I'm subscribed to have far fewer, but still contain interesting information:

* The Royal Statistical Society's [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?forum/rss-csml#!forum/rss-csml)
* Sheffield's [Managing uncertainty in complex models](http://www.mucm.ac.uk/Pages/UCMMailingList.html)
