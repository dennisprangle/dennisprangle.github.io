As I've just started a new job, I've been given a new desktop PC to work on.
I thought I'd keep track of what I install on it so that I've got a complete list for next time.
It's running some (slightly customised?) flavour of ubuntu which includes quite a lot of stuff by default.

##Already installed

- firefox
- thunderbird
- git
- R
- latex

##Additions

- emacs (not installed by default?!)
- dropbox
- julia
- rstan
- quicktile (python script giving keyboard shortcuts for tiling - there's compiz options for this but I can never get them to work)
- thunderbird extensions
  - exQuilla (to work with exchange server)
  - markdown here
  - archive here (keyboard shortcuts for moving messages)
- firefox extensions
  - adblock plus
  - lastpass
