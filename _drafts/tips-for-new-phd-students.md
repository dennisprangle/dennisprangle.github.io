Below are some links which I think might be useful for new UK statistics graduate students, with a heavy bias towards what would have been helpful for me.

## Writing papers

Academic writing takes a while to learn and tends to be quite sub-discipline specific.
However there are some sensible suggestions from Jordan Boyd-Graber [here](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/static/style.html),
and in Nick Higham's [book](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/hwms/).

## Programming

A good starting points for using R is Hadley Wickham's [advanced R programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).

I should also plug R books co-written by current and former colleague: Colin Gillespie's [efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)
and Aimee Gott's [teaching yourself R in 24 hours]( [http://www.mango-solutions.com/wp/teach-yourself-r-in-24-hours-book/).

## Version control and collaboration

Here's a [simple introduction](???) to using git for git version control.
For more advance use stack overflow is your friend!

On a smaller scale I find [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is still very useful for sharing documents (and collaborating with people who dislike git!)

## Mailing lists

For UK statistics a useful mailing list is [allstat](http://www.icse.xyz/?page_id=176).
It's mainly for announcements of jobs, events etc rather than discussion.

The [ML-news mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ml-news) is good for the wider machine learning community.

## Writing talks

The default is to write these using LaTeX's [beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_%28LaTeX%29) class.
However there's now an increasing number of alternatives. For example [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) and [Jupyter](???) can make nice presentations based on markdown.

## Podcasts and blogs

Two great long-running blogs are [Christian Robert](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/) and [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/)'s statistics blogs.

Recently I've also been particularly enjoying [Jeremy Kun](https://jeremykun.com/)'s explanations of ideas at the boundary of maths and computer science
and the [talking machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) podcast on machine learning.

## More advice

Terry Tao has some [great advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/) for maths grad students on creativity, productivity etc much of which is applicable to stats as well
He also has a large list of links to essays on similar topics.

## Miscellaneous

Stack exchange

Stack exchange etc.

Comics and humour.

## Jobs

Academia: jobs.ac.uk

Data science

## Conferences

WikiCFP, ISBA?

## Watching seminars

It's useful to attend seminars and other research talks as you can learn a lot and get a feel for what's going on outside your immediate area of research.
Unfortunately many seminars and other research talks are very hard to follow, and this is especially true as a new researcher.
However there are several things you can learn even from a mostly incomprehensible talk:

* Tips on what to avoid if you want to give a widely understood talk!
* Interesting problems, techniques and papers that the speaker uses.
* The sort of sensible questions and criticisms an audience can come up with despite the difficulty of the talk.
